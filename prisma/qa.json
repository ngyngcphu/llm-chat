In those first five years, when a new person joined the company, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. However, when we grew from a company of 10, 20 employees to a company of over 40, our “introduction by immersion” style stopped working. New hires felt lost and isolated, and their first weeks or even months on the job were stressful because of it. There’s as much to unlearn as there is to learn. Prior to this handbook, navigating that path was both somewhat random and almost entirely oral. \n\nSo, this is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about the Dwarves, the company, our culture, our process, and our history. It’s a guide to understanding what people are talking about whether it’s okay to take your vacation when you’ve only been with us for few months (yes), what a benefits package look like, and hopefully everything in-between.\n\nThis handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. \n\nMaking the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated. So whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last. Please do help keep it up to date.\n\nSo many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.\n\nIf you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you. It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been with the Dwarves for a while to spot the broken ways. Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.\n\nSections\nDwarves Foundation Is You\nGetting Started\nBenefits & Perks\n\nIntroduction to Dwarves Foundation\nWhat We Stand For\nWhat We Value\nWho Does What\nHow We Work\nWhere We Work\nMaking a Career\nHow We Hire\nHow We Spend Money\nTools & Systems\n\nGuides & Resources\nMoonlighting\nEffective Meeting\nSecurity Rules\nPlaces to Work\nMarketing Assets\nFAQ\n\nProcess\nLeave Request\nAssets\nEmail Communication and Use\nContinuing Education Allowance\nReimbursement\n\nContributing\nWe love pull requests.

Some benefits don't make sense in other countries. We will try our best to provide comparable benefits and perks as it makes sense, though.\n\nTeam Growth\nContinuing Education Allowance (CEA)\nWe encourage you to grow by learning and playing with new technologies. You'll get a yearly budget for your learning and development goals, from books to conferences.\n\nIf you're interested in taking classes that you feel improve you professionally or personally, you have a $300 annual stipend to do so. This benefit is applied to any full-time Dwarf who has been here for more than 6 months.\n\nConference\nIn the case of conferences, the company will pay 50% of all expenses for approved job-related conferences and seminars. We'll pay 100% of the expenses if you participate as Guest Speaker.\n\nTo get approval to attend a conference, submit a request to the Ops Team. In your request, provide as much detail as possible about the conference dates, your total expected out-of-office time, the costs of attending, the benefits expected to be gained by attending, any potential disruption to client work, etc. We will check on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWork Supplies Expense\nThe company will pay for work-related expenses, such as software or office supplies. If you have any doubts about whether or not to expense something, just ask. Get a receipt when you purchase work supplies. Take a photo of that receipt, and send it along with the request ticket in Basecamp for the reimbursements via the paycheck.\n\nProject Commission\nThe company will pay a commission on revenues it receives from each project which the employee procures. The commission will consist of 5% of the gross revenues for the project. This may be split amongst multiple salespeople. A project does not have to have a salesperson.\n\nYear-End Gift\nAt the end of every year, Dwarves gives a thank-you gift to employees. This gift comes in the form of a cash bonus / or as presents. The bonus is accompanied by a beautiful keepsake that contains ideas & inspiration for how to use your bonus, but ultimately how you spend it or save it is up to you.\n\nMonday Radio Talk\nWe work and grow alongside tech. Besides the daily project work, the team forms different study groups based on mutual tech interests. It is either learning new techniques, discussing trends, creating products or applying practice that benefits in the long run.\nWe host a weekly Monday Radio Talk, where each presenter showcases their learning to the team. After each session, we format the audio file and upload them onto Dwarves Youtube.\n\nWe also reserve a budget to reward the valuable knowledge from the team. The more you contribute, the more bonus you get up to no limits.\n\nTeammate Support\nEmployee Liquidity Pool\nIf Dwarves Foundation is ever sold or part of an IPO, tenured employees will be eligible to receive a portion of 5% of the company's value. That 5% would be divided into units, based on the number of employees we have at the time. People at Dwarves Foundation for less than 1 year would receive 0 units, someone employed 1 year would receive 1 unit, and so on, until you're fully vested at 5 years for 5 units.\n\nEmployee Stock Option Plan\nYou can own the company if you don't want to be just tenured employees. As part of the package, being a significant contributor will give you the right to buy a certain amount of company shares at a predetermined price. We will discuss this on a case-by-case basis.\n\nEmployee Referral Bonus\nWe usually hire, and to keep the quality bar, the Dwarves are encouraged to recommend friends that you think they match with the team. We believe your suggestions should be helpful as you have to know the person.\n\nThe company will pay a referral bonus to any employee who refers an applicant to our company hired by the company to a full-time position. The bonus is only applicable once the applicant successfully becomes a full-time Dwarves and is a part of at least one project. \nThe referring employee must still be employed with the company when the bonus is to be given.\n\nEmployee Profit-Sharing \nDwarves sometime offer 5 - 10% of its annual company profits with employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure. Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous fiscal year, usually around March.\nThis model is eligible to participate after two years of working at Dwarves Foundation. The Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the profit sharing program if you resign or are terminated from Dwarves.\n\nPaid Time Off\nDwarves Foundation offers two weeks of paid vacation, a few extra personal days to use at your discretion, and the official national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so no problem if you need a couple of extra days. We don't track your days off; we use the honor system. Just make sure to check with your team before taking an extended absence so they're not left in the lurch.\n\nShort-term Disability\nOn top of Paid Time Off, the company offers a self-funded short-term disability (STD) plan to all its employees. If you fall ill or injure yourself and cannot work because of it, let us know, and you can take 30 days off at 75% pay. If after that, you're still unable to work, the STD policy kicks in, and you'll continue to earn 50% of your salary until you're better, up to 6 months off. These days are an emergency reserve, in addition to your vacation/sick time described above. If you still cannot work after this period, talk to your manager, and we will discuss what comes next on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFlight Tickets to Dwarves Hubs\nWe encourage our teammates to try out the Dwarves Hubs across the country. Besides the HQ in HCMC, Dwarves Hubs are also located in Da Lat & Da Nang. \n\nWe provide a package of flight ticket 4 times a year, with a maximum amount of 2.000.000 VND for each travel time. With a borderless software firm, we believe that giving people the flexibility to try out the work hubs and visit their teammates is a must. \n\nAnnual Healthcare\nWe do have Bao Viet insurance, but we wish to provide more healthcare services beyond that. This annual healthcare supports the Dwarves with a healthcare package of 4.000.000VND, takes place annually around February or March, which includes:\nOverall healthcare checkup\nCancer screening\nFemale & Male healthcare\nEar, nose & throat\nBlood & urine examination (sample test will be taken at our office)\n\nIf you request further checkup, a 5-25% discount will be applied for full-time employees.\n\nParental Leave\nWhen you welcome a new child, we encourage you to take up to 6 months leave for primary caregivers not more than 2 months before giving birth. The father is allowed up to 5 days of leave as a secondary caregiver. And if you have twins, you can take up to 10 fully paid days off. All parental leaves are at 100% base salary.\n\nThese benefits only applied for full-time Dwarves who have been on-boarded for more than 6 months in advance of pregnancy (internship and probation period are omitted)","questions":"1.

While large companies have established career ladders, most companies sacrifice them to stay “flatter” and “more agile”. In reality, there’s no such thing as a “flat” organization—having one means that people don’t spend time talking about or thinking about levels and promotions because there are so many other things to do. However, one of the main reasons people move out is because they experience stagnation in their careers.\n\nWe often talk about how to scale our organization, and how to build innovative products but it’s impossible if we cannot retain our talents and have a high standard to look for new joins. For all of those reasons, we wrote this ladder to enable software engineering managers to have meaningful conversations with their direct reports about the expectations of each position and how to plan for the next level in their careers without compromising consistency in external recruiting.\n\nHow to read the ladder\nThe purpose of the ladder is to create a structure that would allow people to see the big picture, but also dive into details as needed. Even if you do not know all of the details about one step, you should be able to get an idea of what engineers will focus on at that level. The ladder consists of five parts:\n\nEngineering aspects**: four key outcomes that every engineer should achieve. We wanted to be very clear from the start that the elements must be opinionated, in line with our beliefs that they will reinforce our core values and create a successful organization:\n\n  Technical: focus on technical skills, including an engineer’s mastery, best practices, quality & testing, design, debugging, performance optimization, and scalability.\n  Execution: focus on how an engineer gets things done: planning, scoping, estimation skills, getting unstuck, taking ownership, strategic alignment, product/business understanding, and vision.\n  Influence: focus on the level of impact and influence on people, including leadership, knowledge sharing, mentoring, hiring, and onboarding.\n  Collaboration & communication: focus on teamwork, communication skills, asking for and giving feedback, collaborating, and documentation.\n\n    > We believe that Technical and Execution are “value-adders”, while Influence and Collaboration & Communication are “value-multipliers”. An adder raises the productivity output of their team members, while a multiplier raises the productivity of those around them. As you progress through higher levels, the influence, collaboration & communication become significantly more involved.\n\nCareer path**: give engineers a map of progress. We don’t assume that all engineers should (or want to) aspire to become managers. And leadership is not only for a senior role.\nIndividual contributor track**: outline expectations and examples of engineer’s competencies and responsibilities at every level. While entry levels generally focus on engineers executing work, senior levels focus on mentoring and guiding others in their work.\nManager track**: define the detailed matrix for management roles. Everyone following this path should consider himself a “multiplier”, who unlocks the potential in their team. However, we also wanted to emphasize that this is a technical managing role, not a people ops, thus, the need for technical competency is a must.\nCore values**: remind everyone about the organization's vision, mission, and principles. We expect all members of the engineering team to exhibit the company values in their work.\n","questions":"1. What is one of the biggest challenges in people management mentioned in the text?\n2.

A manager of one is someone who comes up with their own goals and executes them. They don’t need heavy direction. They don’t require daily check-ins. They do what a manager would do — set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc. — but they do it by themselves and for themselves.\nThese people free you from oversight. They set their direction. When you leave them alone, they surprise you with how much they’ve gotten done. They don’t need a lot of handholding or supervision.\n\nHow can you spot these people? Look at their history. Have they been self-sufficient at previous jobs? Have they defined their role before? Have they started their own site/company before? Or done their own thing in some other way? Find someone with initiative and a budding entrepreneurial spirit. And then nurture it.\nYou want someone who’s capable of building something from scratch and seeing it through.

In the below sections, we won't repeat what has been out in our public and try to keep it short.\n\nWe do Agile\nWe build software. The way we see it is a collaboration between multiple people in the team with sufficient knowledge on the domain and clearly understand the project vision that they can quickly adapt to the changes in the market. We adopt the Agile philosophy at this level.\n\nAlso, based on that philosophy, we apply the Scrum framework, which we find out a good fit for us. There are no specific roles in the team at the beginning. There is only the team member who has autonomy and responsibility to meet the goals of the sprint. And there is the Scrum master who is the team member turning into a coach. He works to remove any impediments that are obstructing the team from achieving its sprint goals. The role was supposed to be temporary. A mature team doesn’t need a permanent coach.\n\nCycles\nWe work in an 8-week cycle at Dwarves Foundation. There are typically six cycles to a year. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, work as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning and provide a regular interval to decide what we’re working on.\n\nThe idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take eight weeks or can be completed in that time. However, rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time, and that we bundle smaller things into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed.\n\nA budget thus limits work, and the budget focuses our discussion about what’s reasonable and what’s not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to scope hammer the domain – and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within eight weeks.\n\nCooldown\nIn between each cycle, we spend a week cooling down. That’s the time to deal with various backlogs or bug smashes, writing up what we worked on, and figuring out what we should tackle next. It’s some times tempting to add cooldown onto the end of the cycles, as a way to fit in more work. However, the goal is to resist this temptation. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but it’s helpful to think about the end of the normal cycle as “pencils down.” That means that by week 4 of a normal cycle, we should be winding down, getting ready to launch, make sure QA is lined up, and all the other work that happens during and after the launch of new projects.\n\nMeeting\nAll the meetings could be found on Basecamp Schedule. \n\nAll-hands meeting\nThe all-hands meeting happens at the end of every cycle. The Dwarves look back and decide what to do next.\n\nTeam meeting\nAt the same time, you are a member of either Programmer, Designer, Operation or Business team. We have a team meeting on the last Friday of the month to sit down together. This is the guideline so if in any particular circumstances the team lead can require to adjust the number of meetings.\n\nProject meeting\nEvery project has its meeting schedule. It should follow the company Cycles and Scrum guideline with at least Sprint Planning Meeting and Sprint Retrospective Meeting.\n\nCommunication\nIt’s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means if you just watch the stream of latest activity scrolling along in Basecamp. (It’s also a waste of time and source of stress to even try.) Instead, we have four chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work that’s going on.\n\nFirst, there’s the daily question of What did you work on today?, which supplies the nitty gritty details, but as a personal narrative. They’re a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Please do use them as such! You’re obliged to answer this question at least twice a week when you’re not out.\n\nSecond, there’s the weekly question of What will you be working on this week?, which details your intentions for the coming week. Everyone is obliged to answer this question when they’re not out.\n\nThird, there are heartbeats. These are the team versions of What did you work on this cycle? This is where we summarize and celebrate the work that’s been done. Every team lead is obliged to write or designate someone on the team to write, this account one week after a cycle has ended.\n\nFourth, and finally, there are the kickoffs. These are the team version of What are you going to work on the next cycle? This is where the plan for the coming eight weeks is presented. Every team lead is obliged to write or designate someone on the team to write, this account before the start of the new cycle.\n\nThese mechanisms work together to free individuals and teams to run their days and cycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it’s easier for everyone to build trust in where we’re going and why.\n\nPitches\nWhether you work on product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches.\n\nWrite-up your idea of a new thing, an issue in daily work, a change to a feature, or any other product development you think we should be considered as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then we’ll have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time.\n\nThere’ll always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So it’s important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone involved with product development (and probably most everyone else in the company) will read and consider your pitch. That’s a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesn’t make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point.\n\nHan and An is the team evaluating pitches for inclusion in the next cycle. Before the start of every cycle.\n\nRaising an Issue\nFrom time to time people may have problems or concerns about their colleagues, customers, company leadership, work environment and so forth. We want everyone in the team to be empowered to raise an issue and have it dealt with swiftly and fairly.\n\nHave a conversation with the person involved\n\nThe first thing you can do, if you feel comfortable and able, raises the issue directly with the person concerned. This direct and informal approach is encouraged, and we expect your colleagues who are approached responsibly to respond similarly. This approach may be particularly appropriate in dealing with matters of speech and expression, where individuals may not be aware that their behavior is causing distress.\n\nAsk a colleague to intervene on your behalf\n\nYou may ask a colleague or leader to intervene informally on your behalf. In some situations, you may not feel able to approach the person or people involved directly and so going via a third party to raise your concern for you informally is another option available to you.\nIn particular, if you have a grievance with a leader and feel unable to raise it directly, you should raise this issue either with another leader or with a colleague who can raise it with a leader for you.\n\nIf they can’t help to resolve, you can talk to Han.\n\n1001 types of Check-ins and Icebreaker questions\nSeen any good movie lately? What's one thing inspire you lately? Something you recently discovered? How was your day? Any good piece of English to share? Any new recipe that we should try out?\n\nOf course, you won't have to answer precisely each one of them. None of us does. We prefer it to happen naturally. So don't be surprised if you see a question is paused, but an answer still pops up. That's normal.\n\nWith managers of one\nManaging at Dwarves Foundation is a part-time occupation, next to being involved with doing the work itself. This means we rely on everyone at Dwarves Foundation to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify as managers of one, and we strive for every one senior or above to embody this principle fully.\n\nThat means setting your direction when one isn’t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.\n\nRemote\nWith the deep understanding that Work-Life balance is the real deal. We decided to pick this style of remote working as a primary way to work for the whole company. And everyone can choose to follow it or not. It’s optional but highly recommended.\n\nWe believe that a happy person can deliver 10x quality output compared to others. You cannot stay in the room all the time and can be creative at the same time. People should have the right to use the time of their own and to work anywhere as long as it does not violate the company values.\n\nWe don’t want to manage your chairs.  \n\nWe encourage the team to work remotely. We want our Dwarves to wake up on the beach in the morning, grab a cup of coffee, and start doing the job that they love—or spending the day in a coffee shop downtown to be more socialized. Or take their time to breathe the fresh air in Da Lat, Chiang Mai, or stay at home with their kids at the cozy working-corner to enjoy the alone-zone, best zone to focus and get things done.\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility. \n\nWith managers of one comes to remote working culture. We truly rely on everyone at Dwarves Foundation and believe that we can do the works we all love: deliver the tech know-how to the world.\n\nProject Onboard\nWe have plenty of projects at Dwarves. During project onboarding, we will make sure the newcomers get the ideas about the project types, whether it's a Ventures project, a CSR (Corporate social responsibility) project, or a typical Tech partner one.\n\nEach type of project will have specific expectations on Milestone's understanding, deliverables, and output quality. Craftmanship is a thing; put your pride into every single line of code and deliverables.\n\nWe head toward craftsmanship\nSoftware Craftsmanship is all about putting responsibility, professionalism, pragmatism and pride back into software development.\n\nCraftsmanship is not enough to guarantee the success of a project but the lack of it can be the main cause of its failure. \n\nNext: Work routine","questions":"1.

We share almost everything: every week, a lot of events are open to the public, and some of them are recorded so that anyone can watch the videos to learn. It may seem strange to share so much, but there are good reasons for it.\n\nThe goal of what is shared at Dwarves is not just to make more people learn new technology or knowledge, but to improve the ability of the presenter to communicate their understanding, which will in turn improve their ability to create new things.\n\nIt's not hard to notice that there are quite a few professional programmers who are terrible teachers. There are often two reasons for this: they either don't know how to teach, or they have never learned how to learn from others. When you share knowledge with others, you need to understand your own shortcomings as well as your strengths so that you can explain them effectively. There will sometimes be a \"criticism session\" where others point out any mistakes or room for improvement in your presentation. It will help you recognize and strengthen those weaknesses in yourself by letting you see where your explanations fall short with respect to other people's questions or ideas.\n\nFor this reason, we encourage everyone at Dwarves to share their ideas and learn from each other. This is how we grow as a company.\n\nSharing guideline\nWhen you share, follow the guidelines.\nDo not tackle a subject that is too broad or complex. Instead, choose a narrow one that will keep your audience interested.\nSharing time is less than 60 mins is the best.\nEnglish languages for slides is preferable.\nBefore sharing your findings with others, it's important to discuss them with your manager or other senior people who can provide insights you might not otherwise see.\nA good presentation should outline:\n  What's the problem?\n  How to solve the problem?\n  The best solution or practice\n  The mechanism, key techniques, and source code\n  Pros and cons\n  References\nSlideshows should use the template.\n","questions":"1.

This tradition was founded by Engineering, but anyone (from Design, Product,...) is welcome to participate.\n\nWe value the importance of sharing our work with other people at Dwarves. We hold demos and celebrate our craftsmanship, insight, and learning with others. And it's a chance for people who don't work directly on development to feel included in the process.\n\nWhat to demo?\nWe don't want to scare people away with a long, dull presentation. We want our demos to be short, interesting, and easy to digest. In contrast, here’s how we describe what makes a good demo:\n\nDemos walk the team through something that is recently completed or is a work in progress. Share feature work, bug fixes, performance improvements, instrumentation, integrations, prototypes, and refactors. Keep demos to 5-10 minutes and include:\n\nA light, quick description of what the work is, why it matters and who it benefits.\nA working example that shows how the thing works; i.e., not a code walkthrough.\nA before and after state (in case of an improvement).\nWhat might be the next step?\n\nBug fixes and performance improvements can help to make the product better. Instrumentation that improves our own observability is also useful. Prototypes are great to work on, including design mocks. We cheer loudly when I see people demo this stuff.\n\nThough there are many things we want people to - No shaming. We encourage people to share their work. We don't want anyone to feel pressured, though. Just come and enjoy the work of your colleagues, and think about how you might do it one day.\nNo PowerPoint**.

At both Amazon, Google and other companies, it’s just around one year. At Dwarves Foundation, it’s just around three years as of late 2018. That’s something to be proud of, and something to ensure endures. When you work at Dwarves Foundation, it should be feasible to think about this as the place for making a life-long career.\n\nMastery & Titles\nAdvancing your career at Dwarves Foundation doesn’t mean giving up on your craft and moving into “management.” Whether you work in programming, design, ops, support, or whatever, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we’re a relatively small company with just two layers of managerial cake: executives and team heads. And both the executives and heads still spend the majority of their time doing actual work themselves as well.\n\nWe’ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to six different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will, of course, be different. Here’s an example of the titles for programming:\n\nFresh Programmer\nJunior Programmer\nProgrammer\nSenior Programmer\nLead Programmer\nPrincipal Programmer\n\nWhile this is how we recognize mastery, it’s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. We need people and perspectives from all levels of skill. Also, for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+.\n\nHowever, these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at Dwarves Foundation. Note that these titles are about a particular role at Dwarves Foundation. Someone may well have been a “Senior Designer” somewhere else with different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at Dwarves Foundation as a “Designer.” We recognize mastery and titles at Dwarves Foundation for the work done at Dwarves Foundation.\n\nDay to day, though, these titles aren’t much of a factor. However, they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company, and it gives everyone a clear idea of tracking their career progression.\n\nYou can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: Programmers, Designers, Business.\n\nSalary & Promotion\nYou get the paycheck on the 1st or the 15th of the month depend on your joined day.\n\nEveryone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at Dwarves Foundation. When someone gets a promotion, that goes from one level to the next, they’ll get a corresponding pay raise Mar 1st as well.\n\nThe payroll fund is always reversed at 50% of total revenue. We always try to pays at the top 20% for our industry salary levels. The comparison data is provided by market research company, e.g., Adecco in Vietnam, that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. \n\nThe data is reviewed once per year at the end of January. If it’s warranted, that is if the market rates have gone up, we’ll increase pay on Mar 1st to follow suit. We don’t decrease payment, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we’ll hold them steady until they come up again.\n\nPayroll is run by An, and Han does the transfer. If you’ve got a query on your salary, you can talk to An.\n\nPerformance Review\nWe perform bi-yearly reviews in July and January. Everyone who has been with the company at least 90 days and completed the training courses gets a review. The primary purpose of these reviews is to give feedback on career path advancement and recognize accomplishments. We wrap up our January reviews in time to make promotion related pay adjustments effective Feb 1st. We follow a simple process:\n\nEveryone writes up a 1-2 page summary and sends it to the head of their team.\nThe head of your team reviews your summary and prepares their thoughts. He schedules a one-hour meeting to discuss.\n\nThe head of your team will reach out to you when it’s time for you to write up your review.

It’s not a black and white topic. There are one-time gigs, other pursuits, or opportunities that help you grow and make life interesting. We want to support that. However, we want to make sure professional endeavors outside of Dwarves Foundation don’t create conflicts of interest or affect your time, dedication, or performance at Dwarves Foundation. So it’s a delicate balance.\nWith that in mind, here are some examples of what we’d consider OK and what we would consider a conflict of interest and not OK:\n\nOK\nAn occasional side gig, free or paid, for someone you know. For example, if you want to work on a friend’s website or a design or writing project for something you’re involved with, that’s fine.\nAn occasional speaking gig, free or paid. Is someone going to pay you to give a talk somewhere? That’s fine as long as it doesn’t involve multiple days off for travel (unless you use your vacation time against this travel time).\nA side business that’s different from your day job, as long as the commitment is only a few hours a week. If you come to work exhausted because you’re trying to start a full-time business on the side, it’s going to impact your performance here.\nServe as an advisor for another company, or be on board, as long as there’s no conflict of interest. The time commitment must be under a few hours a month. Also, if there’s a scheduling conflict, Dwarves Foundation gets priority.\nDo volunteer or occasional pro-bono work for a cause you’re actively involved with. A little work here and there is fine, but, for example, becoming an organization’s full-time web designer and being on the hook to work during your standard work day, etc., would not be OK.\n\nNot OK\nYou can’t work full time or part time for another company in our industry. If you’re unclear about what our industry is, and you have a specific situation you’d like to talk about, ping Han or An.\nGo out on a regular speaking circuit tour which is going to require multiple days of travel multiple times a year. That’s too disruptive to our work schedule and your fellow teammates.\nConsult for other companies in our industry where there may be a conflict of interest (a competitor, a product tangentially related to Dwarves Foundation, etc.).\nBe aggressive in marketing your availability for side work. If something comes to you through a friend or some connection, fine, but aggressively promoting something on the side will ultimately result in a conflict of interest here at work.\nTake on anything outside of work that’ll pull attention from work. For example, if you wanted to launch an app, but the app requires providing timely customer support to people who use the app, that’s going to eat into your day here at work. That would ultimately be a problem.\n\nIn general\nHere are a few guiding principles about whether something could be a problem:\nIs it competitive?\nDoes it occupy a disproportionate amount of your time?\nDoes it require you to be away during times when you’re needed at work?\nIs it another paid gig that employs the same skills Dwarves Foundation is paying you for?\nIn general, we’d like to be lenient within reason, but we’re going to be strict if we see it impact your time, attention, or performance here at work.\nIt’s hard to come up with one-size fits all rules.

One-on-one meetings are the way to establish these relationships. Every manager has a 1-1 with each of their direct reports once a week, or whenever convenient for both parties involved. This page will take you through how we conduct a one-on-one at Dwarves Foundation as well as some tips to keep the meeting productive.\n\nThe first meeting\nThe first one-on-one meeting is your chance to set a pattern and standard of how you and your manager feel good about the future and how you two want to interact. In this post, Lara Hogan had a list of questions to ask in an initial one-on-one. We borrow those questions to discuss in our first meeting too.\n\nWhen scheduling a 1:1 with someone, be sure to clarify that this is not an update on project status. People who have not had 1:1 meetings at previous jobs may be confused by this invitation.\n\nAgenda, Notes, and Action Items\nTo have a productive conversation, it's best if you come into the meeting with some ideas in mind for what will be discussed. If you are the mentee, remember this meeting is for you so you should be the person to prepare the outline. Managers can contribute items too, but ultimately your agenda should take a front seat.\n\nAfter the 1:1, take notes on what you discussed and add action items for things both of you committed to, so that when you meet again you can review them and see how things progressed.\n\nIn the meeting\nDuring one-on-one meetings, it's important to focus on listening and understanding. If you are the manager, you need to encourage your reports to be open and honest about what's working and not working. Essentially, this means not letting your reports make the mistake of telling you what they thought you want to hear instead of what they actually felt.\n\nIn addition, it is important to change one's mindset as well. To stop treating a one-on-one meeting as a formal meeting, and instead turn them into conversations. Such meetings will end up yielding better results.\n\nWhat to discuss\nThere is a wide range of subjects to be covered in a 1:1 meeting, including but not limited to the following:\n\nBig picture:** any questions about the company’s direction and changes. People need to know what's going on at the company so they know best how to contribute and feel invested in the company's success.\nFeedback:** the secret to outstanding performance is a regular flow of feedback. As people strive to improve the quality of their work, it's hard for them to follow the right path if they don't know what standards and expectations they need to meet.\nCareer:** career growth and development is always a top concern for people in the workplace. Whenever possible, take the time to bring up any skills you'd like to improve upon, new things you'd like to try, or a new role you aspire to.\nPersonal:** one-on-one conversations foster mutual understanding and connection. It's normal to talk a bit about seemingly irrelevant topics—a new read, a recent trip—to get to know someone better.\n\nTime and Schedule\nThe frequency and duration of 1:1 meetings varies between individuals. A good default is weekly and half an hour long. Try to keep the gap between meetings no longer than two weeks. The goal of 1:1s is building relationships, which takes time; it's hard to get close to someone if you don't speak frequently.\n\nOnce the calendar is set, make sure you never cancel a 1:1. It's fine to reschedule sometimes but cancellation is a sign of letting people think you don't value their time. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE.\n","questions":"1.

Apart from team projects, we still have multiple stand-up meeting with clients. If you have things to discuss with the team or tasks to handover/ delegate, this should be the right time.

There are many startups found and raise fund every day. They focus on making significant positive changes, impact millions of people, lead to breakthroughs and support the foundation of economic growth.\n\nBuilding an innovation startup requires lots of different things, and it is tough. Most of them have to deal with business development, legal, fundraising, team recruitment, and product development at the same time. Tech startups need to move fast and break things. \n\nAt some points, growing a startup needs a strong and experienced team behind. The software team that can help to design the system, design the database, produce the well-crafted software, keep the system stable, avoid the technical debt and deliver values is one of the critical pieces to solve the puzzle.\n\nAnother motivation for Dwarves Foundation was the lack of respect that service firms receive. Most software companies out there focus on digital transformation and consultancy. The nature of the business with a tight deadline and budget force them to do tricks. They hit and run. The codebase and software they produced are full of crap, and it damages our pride. \n\nThis is where Dwarves Foundation comes in.\nDespite the fact that service firms scale linearly, their ultimate size is capped and small, they don’t have life-changing exits for their founders, we start Dwarves Foundation as we want to build things right. I’ve always felt that companies like Dwarves Foundation are more important to the economy than the mildly pejorative phrase used to describe them.\n\nDwarves Foundation is an innovation service firm. We have been building an organization with high standard software practices and business growth capabilities, helping tech startups, entrepreneurs and makers deliver their innovative software product since 2013.\n\nWe stand for the craftsmanship in software development. More than telling people how to do things, as a firm, we take responsibility for collaboratively creating the product of innovation with the client. We value the long-term partnership, and we brought the economic impact through massive product distribution and brought to the market by the clients. \n\nThis is what we do here. It takes many forms, and we’re always working towards better software craftsmanship.\n\nThe name: Dwarves\n\nIt begins in Norse Mythology. After the executed of Ymir, the very first giant of the universe, by Odin has conceived a whole new universe. In the new world, Yggdrasill is a giant ash tree located at the center cradles the nine realms of the cosmos.\n\nDwarf is the small and misshapen creatures that originated as maggots from Ymir’s corpse. They dwell in the mountains deep down in the dark underground of Svartalfheim. Dwarves are wisdom, natural good at smithing, mining, and crafting. They are well known for being the best blacksmiths throughout the nine worlds, not only do they have natural abilities to craft weapons and jewelry. They are also excellent engineers and architects.\n\nDwarvish magic was fundamentally technological know how. They had an unusually high level of skill. There was no shimmering light around the Dwarves, just first rate workmanship. Dwarves greatly pride themselves in their craftsmanship, be it smithing or anything else.\n\nThe dwarf is an example of a creature who has the ability that surpasses the known world, presaging the rise of a universe beyond this physical realm. Whatever their origin, the dwarf’s existence plays a role in expanding the imagination.\n\nAspiring to create a positive breakthrough that can be able to rewrite the new world, we chose the name Dwarves Foundation as the commitment to the vision that we follow.\n\nAt our woodland, the Dwarves are encouraged to thoroughly assess and evaluate the product quality before handing it to the customers. By participate in every detail of the work, we take craftsmanship as one of the most fundamental factors of the career transformation for engineers. World-class products require world-class engineers and craftsmanship is what makes it done. Craftsmanship is what flows among the team spirit, or does not exist at all.\n\nWe choose innovation to be one of our core values that form ideas to affect the general society undoubtedly. Innovation is not for geniuses working alone, it is an activity that requires the team effort. Being innovative is a part to approach the new era. What that rewards, what can I say, can genuinely lead to significantly remodel the cosmo.\n\n","questions":"1. What are some of the challenges that startups face when trying to innovate?\n2.

The value is important to us. They are what we proud of. They help guide us when we are facing a difficult decision. They will be the things you like about what we do at Dwarves Foundation and how we do it.\n\nOur core values guide our strategies and individual actions so that we create a company whose character is as radical as our work. \n\nCraftsmanship**: We work toward perfection in every single piece that we produce. We are proud of the well-crafted software that we develop together.\nTeamwork**: Teamwork is all about trust and collaboration. Having someone in the team mean we can rely on this person.\nSustainable**: We think long-term. We do not believe in rushing for project and working overtime. We believe in working sustainably and balanced so that we are a happy bunch of sane workers. Software requires good brains to create good codes and good processes.\n\nCulture Code\nThere is no such specific guide for culture code. So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s a sham. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.\n\nWe believe the culture is defined by whom we hire, what we promote and encourage. It is dynamic, and it should expand like our business. We welcome its change as long as we still stay on the ground. Just like we want people to contribute new skills and ideas, we want people to contribute to the new culture.\n\nA few other things that we observed over the last few years:\nNo asshole rules: no matter how great a candidate may be, being an asshole is an automatic deal-breaker.\nFalse Positives are ok. False Negatives are not**: we prefer to not have you in the team rather than letting a wrong person affect the others.\n\nPeople\nIt all started with people\nYes, it does. Everything only makes sense with us, the human at the centre of it. Everything we want to accomplish starts with our will. Any ideas of how to make a better future begin with us. This company focuses on innovation, and those result only matter if they benefit us. We are in the centre and are the beginning of everything.\n\nAt Dwarves, you are the manager of yourself. Things you produce add up to our value. Your action in front of others represents our image. Your belief impacts team culture. When things went wrong, we look into the team and the inner self, rather than pointing the finger. After all, we human are the cause of any consequences. That's our point of view. \n\nSo, live your value with the Dwarves. You are encouraged to contribute your knowledge and value to the team. \n\nTeam > I\nWorking in a team is like riding a boat, it requires collaboration. The team need heroes, and there should be an 'I' in the team, but the only way to make the boat go fast is perfect coordination, it also means perfect teamwork and synchronization. The skillset is essential, but it isn't as important as vision and coordination. The 'I' must be unselfish and think about the team first. \n\nAs a team member, it's important to remember that no one is perfect; everyone has something that they could improve upon, including yourself. So, be supportive. Offer constructive criticism. Listen, listen, listen. People who always talk, but never listen will be stunted in growth.\n\n\"Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.\" — Bill Nye\n\nWe effectively have an environment in which competition and collaboration co-exist and feed off each other. Competition, synchronization or collaborating perfectly; make the boat go fast is always the main point. Remember, even if you work harder than anyone else, if you lose synchronization, you slow the boat down.\n\nIt's not about you\nEverything that happens here is not about anyone in this company. It's not about the CEO, the core team or anyone. They are here because they want to join forces to accomplish the mission of craftsmanship in software engineering. They want to pursue the ultimate goal of empowering innovation.\n\nThe Dwarves is more like an idealogy. When we start this company, we think about how cool it is to make the idealogy happens, how cool it is to bring impact to the world and make a meaningful living.\n\nThe portion split accordingly. We have rules for the Dwarves who are in that same path, who also want to contribute and make the next products feasible. We work together as a team for a greater good because as soon as it becomes about the individual, things begin to fall apart.\n\nLike-minded people\nWe started this team with a purpose. It's an innovation powering. The long-term goal is to create an engine for innovation where new ideas happen, we can develop things & bring positive impacts. We want to make this place an environment where engineers can spend their time working with disruptive startups and be cool at the same time.\n\nTo achieve that, it requires a lot of hard work and commitment. That's why we always look for like-minded people, who with the same vision, DNA and same synergy. The ones which are distinctive, different, can see things in their bare form and be optimistic about the future are the right people we'd love to work with.\n\nUnique Value\nWhen it comes to hiring, we look at the good part of every person. We hire for the unique value. This is what you could bring to the table. This is what makes you different from other team members and me.\n\nBeing different from others is always a source of value. The difference can be anything. The way of thinking could be different. The vision of technology. The methodology of operations. Presentation skills. Communication skills. Leadership. The speed of prototyping. Emotional understanding of others. Anything can be the difference.\n\nWe must be an organization where those specialities are well respected and leveraged, rather than having stereotyped technical skill evaluations like school exams.\n\nEQ is underrated\nWe have seen so many cases where smart engineers with high IQ failed while some others yield positive results. Most of the time, it is communication.\n\nAt times, Clients often tell us what feature needed to be done rather than what problem they wanted to solve. Failing to see it through will lead us to a stage where it is technically impossible to do the feature while there many other possible approaches to the original problem. This one, along with many similar cases is why Clients (and people) prefer working with someone (or company) to another.\n\nAs a software firm, it is our job to convince and recommend solution. Features, tasks and bugs live in one side of a coin where technical matters and solution are already identified. Train your mind to be able to see the real big picture.\n\nYou are what you do\nPeople see you through your action, not talks. Be a doer. We craft software and stuff. We want to bring positive impact to the world through software. \n\nAt Dwarves, we favour building over talk. Working with other Dwarves, we prefer to work with one who brings value to the table and make things happen.\n\nThe culture we are pursuing is the combination between the unconventional spirit and the will to do the right things in every piece of our decision, not just follow the existing of which has been said for years.\n\nWork\nRemote Working\nWe feel no need to manage your chair. In other words, we have better things to do than to track you down to every single minute. Meetings are for decision making. Ideas and planning should be conducted personally.\n\nBut that doesn't mean things can go off the track. Flexible working time can be a double-edged sword. It allows you to start and end thing at whenever you feel like it, which is why we want the Dwarves to know exactly how their day will transpire. What needs to be done. What's left to clean up. \n\nIt doesn't matter if it happens in the kitchen, or on your way to the beach. Work happens when you are ready, and we want you to manage it at your own terms fully. Just make sure you know when thing happen and what to do about it. That's all we need. \n\nAround the clock\nWe work for the future of ourselves and the future of this team. We care about the quality of the work we produce rather than the number of hours worked. We do not have a specific start time or time to leave the office. \n\nThe Dwarves are working in a different timezone. We stay in touch around the clock. The Dwarves are around when you need them. Just don't try to take advantage of someone's balance.\n\nToward automation\nTime is the only real currency that we have. All the techniques we applied, all the new technologies we learned at Dwarves Foundation help to save time and make automation easier. If there is anything happened more than 3 times and a dozen more in the future, we find a way to automate it. \n\nSoftware is eating the world. The thing we did today the machine can help to do it tomorrow. Having the engineering power aside, if we know how to use them efficiently, we can utilize them for most of our tedious work and focus on things that matter. Try not to repeat yourself. \n\n70/50\nThe Dwarvish magic is purely technological know-how. The Dwarves often spend their free-time on hobby projects or new technology.\n\nThe 20% we put more into our work is the extra effort to increase the chance to reach a new height. The total of 120% is our commitment. It's encouraging for most of us and not required. The 20% more are rewarded when things we build or explore hit the market or bring values to the customers.\n\nPurpose-driven\nIt's all about the result, thus every action or decision should either bring us closer to the goal. Working with the client as the consultant, we should be aware of what makes a successful collaboration.\n\nRemote clients are always worried about whether we can deliver. No updates are assumed no \"working\". We don't manage chairs, but not everyone does. Transparency and detailed planning/report help. Insist on (meaningless) daily meetings for updates is a sign of trust issue and cargo cult agile.\n\nRemember to make the development progress as transparent as possible\nBe a team player over \"task worker\".\nFavour open discussion and alternative recommendation instead of rejection over customer's requests\n\nHow we do business\nIn working with others, we don't look for business, we look for partnership. We value lifetime partners. A deal could come and go, the market could come and go, but trusted clients will stay. When you worked with someone else, once people know that we can actually deliver well-crafted output, nobody wants to take another adventure to check out other options or vendors. It's not worth the extra effort to do that.\n\nSame as networking and collaboration, doing business is about giving, not taking. We tend to pay upfront in many cases, we give what we have before asking anything back.\n\nUnfortunately, many people do not have this perception when it comes to dealing business. People often view business as \"what can you do to support me?\", rather than \"what can we do to grow together?\" perspective. Maybe it was because the modern world has been filled with doubts and skeptic, or maybe it was because of the bitter past experience when they chose the wrong partners, modern business owners tend to focus more on getting the fast, instant goods, rather than investing in a long-term, sustainable plan.\n\nDelegators are dead-weight    \nEverybody works. With a small team, you need people who are going to do work, not delegate work. Everyone's got to be producing. No one can be above the work.\n\nThat means you need to avoid hiring delegators, those people who love telling others what to do. Delegators are dead weight for a small team. They clog the pipes for others by coming up with busywork. And when they run out of work to assign, they make up more—regardless of whether it needs to be done.\n\nDelegators love to pull people into meetings, too. In fact, meetings are a delegator's best friend. That's where he gets to seem important. Meanwhile, everyone else who attends is pulled away from getting real work done.\"\n\nEffective over productive\nBeing productive is about occupying your time—filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much done as you can. Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work. We don't believe in busyness. We believe in effectiveness. \n\nIn a certain amount of time, we always try to work on things what create the most value possible. Between signal & noise, we always try to pick the signal and waive the noise.\n\nKnow your priority and do things that matter.\n\nEngineering Culture\nWe build a company where software engineering could shine, innovative products are shipped and change the world for the better.\n\nEngineering Discipline\nSoftware engineering is an engineering discipline that's applied to the development of software in a systematic approach.\n\nNot applying software engineering methods results in more expensive, less reliable software, and it can be vital in the long term, as the changes come in, the costs will dramatically increase.\n\nNot a replaceable cog\nIn every software, the engineering team is one of the most crucial factors to make it successful. Software is more of artisanship, and software engineers aren't a replaceable cog.\n\nPeople have an assembly line mindset leftover from the industrial age. Don't believe the one-size-fits-all interview process with white-boarding problems. These serve to grind away the individuality and make us feel like an assembly line worker.\n\nThe best idea wins\nIf you have a great idea and the will to make it work, you can create great changes. Nothing is off-limits — we're continually looking for improvements in our people, our processes, and our products. All voices are equal here — we hire people to have opinions and perspectives. \n\nIf your idea makes the most sense, that's what we'll do, regardless of your role or seniority.\n\nLean approach\nLean philosophy regards everything, not adding values to the customer as waste. In order to eliminate waste, one should be able to recognize it. Partially done work, extra processes like paperwork and features not often used by customers are waste. Rework, or unnecessarily complex solutions are waste. Waiting for other activities, teams, processes is waste. Managerial overhead not producing real values is waste.\n\nApproach and process are not so much important than a fulfilled goal - the only matter. As such, fancy tools and cumbersome procedures are likely to bring more problems than helping us moving forward.\n\nDuring work, always remember that you are the manager of one. You should be aware of what is success and what is the priority of a specific period. There's always someone who will give false directions or noise. Catch the signal and waive the noise. \n\nFavour boring solutions and legacy tooling for real benefits over shiny, over-hyped new toys .eg \"Hacker News trending\", \"10k Github stars in X days\" or \"faster than Y framework\".\n\nBe practical, don't waste time and effort on uncertainties.\n\nThink long-term\nHow to know if we make the right decision?\n\nEvery action could create a continuous pair of cause and effect. \nWhen we make any decision, we follow a shared framework among the Dwarves. As everything here is not about you, it's about the majority. \n\nEvery decision we make today can lead to an impact in the future. The technology we endorse, the solution we choose to solve the problem; The founder we backed, the startup we invest into; The people we work with, the way we treat the client. It also includes how we talk about ourselves, the attitude toward peers.\n\nWe grant everyone at Dwarves the rights to make a decision as long as it benefits the whole in the long run, rather than the individual or a blink of an eye. It is the balance of one who walks a tightrope.\n\nToward the future\n\nThought on software\nThe world is running on software. Software is all around us, yet few people think much about the many ways that software impacts the world every day. Software is used by businesses to communicate worldwide. It is used to operate some of the most complex medical machines. The software also helps make life convenient.\n\nSoftware is eating the world. Whatever the future holds, it is a good bet that software will remain an essential part of it. As computer software becomes more sophisticated, it will help people with more complex challenges.\n\nIn the future, the software may even help us to regulate and improve our own bodies. Today's wearable technology and implanted medical devices are just the beginning of what the next generation of software can do.\n\nTech industry is the destination and interference zone between sectors. It's the most fast-pacing environment and the future where human will put all the effort to push its boundary.\n\nIt's the tunnel to the future. The performance and survival of a large number of organizations now depend on their ability to integrate digital at the heart of their business strategy. The world can't operate without software.\n\nBuild the resilient future\nThe humankind is standing in front of a huge opportunity to increase the boundary of many sectors. The future we are heading to is full of excitement and dynamic. Without the ability to judge what is good for the later generation, we may encourage action with bad impact unintentionally.\n\nSo as an ambitious team who is going to co-create the future together with startups and makers, we should always be aware of our actions and think long-term. It's the only way to prevent us from making the wrong decision and create a sustainable future.\n\n","questions":"1. What are the core values that guide the Dwarves Foundation?\n2.

Anyone is welcome to visit Saigon and work from the office at any time.\n\nFrom home\nA few people at Dwarves Foundation are based in other countries and they work from home most of the time. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: a good chair and a good desk.\n\nFrom coffee shops\nWorking from home all the time isn’t everyone’s cup of coffee. Thus, lots of us choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces either some of the time or a lot of the time.

Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Dwarves Foundation, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Dwarves Foundation is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction.

We would love everyone in the company to go above and beyond these expectations. In fact we pretty much expect everyone in the company to be meeting them and then asking us what more they can do to help.\nWhen we see people pushing the limits of their current role, and when we see people already fulfilling other roles we will jump on this as soon as we notice to offer up extra activities or even a new role.\nWe want to foster a culture where everybody feels empowered to do their role and as they feel comfortable and ready to push in any direction they wish.\n\nBelow you’ll find a list of the major groups and teams within the company.
